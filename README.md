# Git hours

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours)

Estimate time spent on a git repository.

**For example time spent on [Twitter's Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**

```javascript
âžœ  bootstrap git:(master) githours
{
  "total": {
    "hours": 6345,
    "commits": 9705
  }
}
```

From a person working 8 hours per day, it would take more than 2 years to build bootstrap.

## How it works

The algorithm for estimating hours is quite simple.

<br><br>

![](docs/step0.png)

*Go through all commits and compare the difference between
them in time.*

<br><br><br>

![](docs/step1.png)

*If the difference is smaller or equal then a given threshold, group the commits
to a same coding session.*

<br><br><br>

![](docs/step2.png)

*If the difference is bigger than a given threshold, the coding session is finished.*

<br><br><br>

![](docs/step3.png)

*To compensate the first commit whose work is unknown, we add extra hours to the coding session.*

<br><br><br>

![](docs/step4.png)

*Continue until we have determined all coding sessions.*

The algorithm in [~30 lines of code](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours/blob/master/index.js#L101-L130).

## Install

    npm install -g nodegit
    npm install -g git-hours

Nodegit library is a bit unstable and might crash randomly.

## Usage

In root of a git repository run:

    githours

**Note: repository is not detected if you are not in the root of repository!**

Help

    Usage: githours [options]

    Options:

      -h, --help                                 output usage information
      -V, --version                              output the version number
      -b, --branches [branches]                  list of branches to calculate commits from e.g. master,dev. Default: all local branches
      -d, --max-commit-diff [max-commit-diff]    maximum difference in minutes between commits counted to one session. Default: 120
      -a, --first-commit-add [first-commit-add]  how many minutes first commit of session should add to total. Default: 120

    Examples:

     - Estimate hours of project

         $ githours

     - Estimate hours of development branch

         $ githours --branches development

     - Estimate hours in repository where developers commit more seldom: they might have 4h(240min) pause between commits

         $ githours --max-commit-diff 240

     - Estimate hours in repository where developer works 5 hours before first commit in day

         $ githours --first-commit-add 300

## Release

* Commit all changes
* Run `grunt release`, which will create new tag and publish code to GitHub
* Edit GitHub release notes
* Release to NPM

        git checkout x.x.x
        npm publish


To see an example how to release minor/major, check https://github.com/geddski/grunt-release

## Test

Tests can be run with command

    grunt test

or

    npm test

You need to have *mocha* installed globally with `npm install -g mocha`.
